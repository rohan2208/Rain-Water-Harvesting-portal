									<h3>What is Rainwater Harvesting</h3>
									<h4>Rainwater harvesting is a technology used to collect, convey, and store rainwater from relatively clean surfaces like the roof, rock catchment, or land surface – essentially for later use. This collected rainwater is either directed to recharge groundwater or stored in a rainwater tank.</h4>

                                   <h4> Rainwater harvesting isn’t some modern technology, it has been practiced for over 4,000 years throughout the world. Traditionally in arid and semi-arid areas, rainwater harvesting systems have provided water for domestic use, drinking, livestock, and small irrigation purposes. Today, rainwater harvesting is gathering a lot of significance as a modern, water-saving and simple technology.</h4>

										<h3>Water Butts</h3>
										<p>Probably the simplest form of rainwater harvesting is the water butt that can now be found in many gardens across the UK. They are large plastic containers for collecting water from one drain pipe or through natural rainfall, and are mainly kept for use in the garden to water plants. It will cost you around £50 for a good quality butt that will last a long while and knock something off your metered water bill in the process.</p>

                                        <p>If you have a decent sized garden then a butt can help you reduce your water consumption from the mains. They can also be paired with something like a Rainsaucer, essentially an upside down umbrella that can collect rainwater more efficiently and cleanly than a gutter.</p>

									<h3>Commercial Rainwater Harvesting</h3>
									<p>The difference for commercial premises that have rainwater harvesting is mainly in the size – the general technology remains the same, if a little more hi-tech. For taller buildings gravity feed systems can often be the more economical option because of the higher water pressure that can be generated. Rainwater harvesting systems in new builds are becoming far more commonplace with new government guidelines and the requirements of industry bodies such as BREEAM that are trying to ensure businesses become more sustainable.</p>

                                    <p> The savings for large scale commercial rainwater harvesting can be quite considerable compared to domestic systems. The project undertaken for North Chadderton Academy in Oldham has a tank with a capacity for storing up to 50,000 litres and provides a saving on mains water of nearly 3 million litres a year. It can do this because of the large roof space that is utilised to feed into the tank.</p>

										<h3>DOMESTIC RAIN WATER </h3>
										<p>it is categorized into 2 parts- </p>
										<h4>1. Surface runoff harvesting</h4>
                                        <p>In urban area rainwater flows away as surface runoff. This runoff could be caught and used for recharging aquifers by adopting appropriate methods.</p>

                                        <h3>2. Rooftop rainwater harvesting</h3>
                                        <p>It is a system of catching rainwater where it falls. In rooftop harvesting, the roof becomes the catchments, and the rainwater is collected from the roof of the house/building. It can either be stored in a tank or diverted to artificial recharge system. This method is less expensive and very effective and if implemented properly helps in augmenting the groundwater level of the area.</p>

									<h3> Direct-Pumped</h3>
                                      <p>Another very common and professional type of rainwater harvesting.</p>

                                     <p> <span style="color: black"> Submersible – </span> Used particularly in domestic settings and is the easiest systems to install. The pump is placed within the underground tank and the harvested water is pumped directly to WCs or other appliances used daily for domestic purposes.</p>
                                      <p><span style="color: black">Suction – </span>  In this system, the pump is located within the control unit of the house (e.g. utility room). This unit also deals with backup from the mains water supply, hence there is no need to direct mains water down to the underground tank.</p>
                                      <p>Most rainwater harvesting systems need pumps to transfer the collected rainwater from storage tanks to the point of use. Submersible pumps are generally more efficient than suction pumps and do not suffer from the same limitations.</p>

									<h3> Retention Ponds</h3>
                                           <p>Retention ponds are used to collect surface runoff water and improve the quality of water by natural processes like sedimentation, decomposition, solar disinfection, and soil filtration. This type of pond normally has a mud bottom, but in some cases, it may be lined with concrete. The most common use of water collected and harvested by pond harvesting is watering livestock, however, it can also be used for groundwater recharge, irrigation or any other purpose other than potable uses.</p>
